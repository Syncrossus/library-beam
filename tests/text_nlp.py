               'schizophrenia, autism and cancer. Defects in genetic and developmental processes are thought to ' \
               'contribute susceptibility to autism and schizophrenia. Presumably, owing to etiological complexity ' \
               'identifying susceptibility genes and abnormalities in the development has been difficult. However, ' \
               'the importance of genes within chromosomal 8p region for neuropsychiatric disorders and cancer is ' \
               'well established. There are 484 annotated genes located on 8p; many are most likely oncogenes and ' \
               'tumor-suppressor genes.   Molecular      genetics and developmental studies have identified 21 genes in ' \
               'this region (ADRA1A, ARHGEF10, CHRNA2, CHRNA6, CHRNB3, DKK4, DPYSL2, EGR3, FGF17, FGF20, FGFR1, ' \
               'FZD3, LDL, NAT2, NEF3, NRG1, PCM1, PLAT, PPP3CC, SFRP1 and VMAT1/SLC18A1) that are most likely to ' \

               'neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson\'s and Alzheimer\'s disease) and cancer. Furthermore, ' \
               'at least seven nonprotein-coding RNAs (microRNAs) are located at 8p. Structural variants on 8p, ' \
               'such as copy number variants, microdeletions or microduplications, might also contribute to autism, ' \
               'schizophrenia and other human diseases including cancer. In this review, we consider the current ' \

               'studies for the role of these 8p genes in neuropsychiatric disease. We also describe how a mutation ' \
               'in an 8p gene (Fgf17) results in a mouse with deficits in specific components of social behavior and ' \
               'a reduction in its dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. We finish by discussing the biological connections ' \

        # u'Inversion of optical configuration of alpha-methylfluorene-2-acetic acid (cicloprofen) in rats and
        # monkeys. A simple and sensitive radiometric method to determine the individual enantiomers of cicloprofen
        # has been developed. 14C-Cicloprofen was converted to its L-leucine diastereoisomers, which were separated
        # by thin-layer chromatography and quantified by measuring the radioactivity in the area corresponding to
        # each individual diastereoisomer. This technique has also been used to measure the enantiomers of unlabeled
        # cicloprofen by condensing with 14C-labeled L-leucine. By using the radiometric method,
        # a unique biotransformation process, the inversion of the (-)-enantiomer of alpha-methylfluorene-2-acetic
        # acid to its (+)-enantiomer, has been demonstrated in the rat and monkey. The rate of (-)- to (+)-inversion
        # was found to be faster in the rat than in the monkey. After single or repeated oral adminstration of the
        # racemic modification or the (-)-enantiomer of cicloprofen to both species, the ratio of (+)- to (
        # -)-enantiomers of cicloprofen in plasma, urine, or bile increased with time. At 5, 22, and 48 hr after oral
        #  administration of a single 50-mg/kg dose of the (-)-enantiomer, 14C-cicloprofen in rat plasma contained
        # 20, 50, and 79%, respectively, of the (+)-enantiomer. After receiving the same dose of (-)-enantiomer,
        # monkey plasma contained 16.5% and 32% of (+)-enantiomer at 8 and 24 hr, respectively. After oral
        # administration of a single 50-mg/kg dose of the (+)-enantiomer of 14C-cicloprofen to rats and monkeys,
        # the percentage of (-)-enantiomer in plasma varied from 2 to 15%. Since the administered (+)-enantiomer
        # contained 4% of (-)-enantiomer and the (+)-enantiomer was excreted at a faster rate than its (-)-antipode
        # by rats or monkeys, it is not known whether an occasional small percentage increase of (-)-enantiomer in
        # plasma resulted from the (+)-to-(-) inversion, or from faster elimination of the (+)-enantiomer.
        # Nevertheless, if (+)-to-(-) inversion does occur in these two species, the rate is much slower than for the
        #  (-)-to-(+) inversion.'
